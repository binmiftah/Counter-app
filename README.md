# Counter-app
The counter app is a simple web application used to count the nummber of books sold in wholesales.
It has an increment button that increases the count value by one and a save button that saves number of books in each wholesale and resets the count value.
And yeah it was a nice project, for a JS staterğŸ˜œğŸ˜œâœŒ
